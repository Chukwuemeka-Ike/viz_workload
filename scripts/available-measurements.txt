# Current list of all available measurements
sys-summary # Summarizes system behavior in 4 charts
            # 1. System CPU [%]
            # 2. System memory usage
            # 3. System IO usage
            # 4. System network usage

cpu-heatmap # Heatmap of all cpu threads vs. time

interrupts  # Heatmap of interrupts summed for each cpu thread vs. time

gpu         # Create 4 charts:
            # 1. Avg GPU/MEMORY utilization
            # 2. Power of each GPU
            # 3. Detail GPU utilization (heatmap)
            # 4. Detail GPU memory utilization (heatmap)


# Only 'sys-summary' is enabled by default
# To enable more measurements in your script, export the MEASUREMENTS variable
# Examples:
export MEASUREMENTS="sys-summary cpu-heatmap interrupts"
export MEASUREMENTS="sys-summary gpu"
